Hello!

This is my php website that connects to a mysql database.

It has a submission form where you can submit information through the form to the database and retrieve information from the database and display it on the website

This program uses XAMPP, which you must download, after which you put all of these files in the "htdocs" folder (indside of another folder).
Then you can open any browser and type localhost/{foldername}


More features comming soon!
