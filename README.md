Hello!

This is my php website that connects to a mysql database.

It has a submission form where you can submit information through the form to the database and retrieve information from the database and display it on the website

This program uses XAMPP, which you must download, after which you put all of these files in the "htdocs" folder (indside of another folder).
Then you can open any browser and type localhost/{foldername}

IN ORDER TO USE THIS CODE WITHOUT CHANGING ANYTHING:
- Create a database called ClubHub
- Create a table called ClubRegistry
- Add the rows called Name, Description, Meeting, Email, Image, verification, Keyword
- The root user must have no password

If you want to change any of the above, you must go directly into the code and do so.

the javascript files are not neccecary for the file, they are to create a database and a table which you will have to go through and change.




More features comming soon!
